# Tutorial: How to Self-Host GitHub Trophies and GitHub Stats Using Vercel

This guide explains how to deploy your **own private instances** of:

* GitHub Profile Trophy
* GitHub Readme Stats

This avoids the public servers, prevents service outages, bypasses API rate limits, and ensures your README always works.

The tutorial reflects a fully working setup tested in practice.

---

# 1. Why Self-Host?

Public GitHub stats/trophy services often fail due to:

* API rate limits
* Vercel deployment pauses
* Too many users sharing one backend

By deploying your own copies on Vercel, you get:

* Your own API quota
* Independent availability
* A stable endpoint for your README

---

# 2. Setup for GitHub Readme Stats (Dynamic Stats Card)

## Step 1: Fork the repository

Fork:

```
https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats
```

Your fork will be used as the source for your Vercel deployment.

---

## Step 2: Deploy the fork to Vercel

1. Open [https://vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. Click Add New → Project
3. Select your fork
4. Deploy with default settings

Vercel automatically creates your domain:

```
https://github-readme-stats-<your-suffix>.vercel.app
```

---

## Step 3: Add your GitHub token to Vercel

The stats service requires GitHub authentication for private repositories and to avoid rate limits.

In Vercel:

Settings → Environment Variables → Add Variable

Name:

```
PAT_1
```

Value:

```
<your_github_pat>
```

Save and redeploy.

---

## Step 4: Use your private stats URL in your README

Example:

```
![GitHub Stats](https://github-readme-stats-<your-suffix>.vercel.app/api?username=behnamasadi&show_icons=true&theme=transparent&count_private=true&include_all_commits=true)
```

You now have a reliable stats card.

---

# 3. Setup for GitHub Profile Trophy (Trophy Badge)

Unlike the stats project, the trophy project recently migrated to Deno. The new version does not work directly on Vercel unless configured exactly as required.

The method below reflects what works.

---

## Step 1: Fork the official trophy repo

Fork:

```
https://github.com/ryo-ma/github-profile-trophy
```

This gives you a Vercel-deployable version.

---

## Step 2: Deploy the fork to Vercel

1. Open [https://vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. Add New → Project
3. Import your trophy fork
4. Deploy with default settings

Your domain will look like:

```
https://github-profile-trophy-<your-suffix>.vercel.app
```

---

## Step 3: Add your GitHub token to Vercel

Unlike the stats project, the trophy project requires a different environment variable name.

Go to:

Vercel → Project → Settings → Environment Variables → Add

Name:

```
GITHUB_TOKEN1
```

Value:

```
<your_github_pat>
```

Save and redeploy.

This exact variable name is required for the current trophy implementation.

---

## Step 4: Use your private trophy URL in your README

The root URL works for trophies.

Example:

```
![trophy](https://github-profile-trophy-<your-suffix>.vercel.app/?username=behnamasadi&theme=onedark&margin-w=10&margin-h=10)
```

You can adjust:

* theme
* margin-w
* margin-h
* no-bg
* no-frame
* row
* column

---

# 4. Recommended Themes and Settings

### GitHub Stats

```
theme=transparent
theme=github_dark
theme=tokyonight
theme=onedark
```

### Trophy Themes

```
theme=onedark
theme=gruvbox
theme=discord
theme=dracula
theme=flat
```

---

# 5. Why This Works

The key points that made everything functional:

1. **GitHub Readme Stats uses PAT_1 as the credential variable**
   Vercel must have `PAT_1` defined.

2. **GitHub Profile Trophy requires GITHUB_TOKEN1 specifically**
   Other names do not work for the current codebase.

3. **Both projects can be deployed using Vercel Hobby**
   No need for paid plans or always-running servers.

4. **Your GitHub README now loads everything from your private Vercel deployments**
   This avoids dependency on the public servers that frequently fail.

# 6. Example Final README Section

```
## GitHub Stats
![GitHub Stats](https://github-readme-stats-<your-suffix>.vercel.app/api?username=behnamasadi&show_icons=true&theme=transparent&count_private=true&include_all_commits=true)

## GitHub Trophies
![trophy](https://github-profile-trophy-<your-suffix>.vercel.app/?username=behnamasadi&theme=onedark&margin-w=10&margin-h=10)
```

Replace `<your-suffix>` with your Vercel project domain.

# 7. Optional Enhancements

You can also add:

* Top Language card
* Contribution streaks
* Custom badges
* Visitor counters
* SVG caching
* Fallback static badges generated via GitHub Actions

# ✅ GitHub Contribution Snake — Working Setup Summary

This documents the **exact steps and fixes** that resulted in a **working snake animation** on my GitHub profile.

---

## 1️⃣ Create the Profile Repository

GitHub renders a profile README from a repository named **exactly** the same as the username.

Example:

```
https://github.com/behnamasadi/behnamasadi
```

The file used is:

```
README.md
```

---

## 2️⃣ Create the `output/` Folder (GitHub UI)

GitHub does not track empty folders, so the folder was created via:

**Add file → Create new file**

Filename:

```
output/.gitkeep
```

This guarantees:

```
output/
```

exists and can receive generated files.

---

## 3️⃣ Add the Snake Workflow

Create:

```
.github/workflows/snake.yml
```

Working workflow (important versions included):

```yaml
name: Generate Snake Animation

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 0 * * *"
  workflow_dispatch:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  generate:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Generate snake animation
        uses: Platane/snk/svg-only@v3
        with:
          github_user_name: behnamasadi
          outputs: |
            output/snake.svg
            output/snake-dark.svg

      - name: Commit and push
        run: |
          git config user.name "github-actions"
          git config user.email "actions@github.com"
          git add output/snake.svg output/snake-dark.svg
          git commit -m "Update snake animation" || exit 0
          git push
```

### Key points that mattered:

* `actions/checkout@v4` (v3 is deprecated)
* `Platane/snk/svg-only@v3`
* Output files written to a **folder**, not a branch
* Files committed back to `main`

---

## 4️⃣ Fix Deprecated Artifact Error

Originally the workflow failed due to:

```
actions/upload-artifact@v3 (deprecated)
```

**Solution**:
Removed the artifact step entirely — it is **not needed** for snake rendering.

Only committing the SVGs is sufficient.

---

## 5️⃣ Correct the README Image URL (Critical Fix)

### ❌ What did NOT work

This path assumes an `output` branch (which does not exist):

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/behnamasadi/behnamasadi/output/snake.svg
```

### ✅ What worked

The file lives in the **main branch**, inside the `output/` folder:

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/behnamasadi/behnamasadi/main/output/snake.svg
```

---

## 6️⃣ Final README Snippet (Working)

```md
![Snake animation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/behnamasadi/behnamasadi/main/output/snake.svg)
```

Optional dark/light mode support:

```md
<picture>
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"
          srcset="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/behnamasadi/behnamasadi/main/output/snake-dark.svg" />
  <img alt="Snake animation"
       src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/behnamasadi/behnamasadi/main/output/snake.svg" />
</picture>
```

---

## 7️⃣ Verification Checklist

All of the following must be true:

* ✅ `output/snake.svg` exists in `main`
* ✅ GitHub Action runs without errors
* ✅ README uses `/main/output/snake.svg`
* ✅ No `output` branch is referenced
* ✅ Workflow commits SVGs back to repo

---

## ✅ Result

* Snake animation renders correctly on the GitHub profile
* Updates automatically (daily or on push)
* No external services needed at render time
* No rate limits
* No broken images
